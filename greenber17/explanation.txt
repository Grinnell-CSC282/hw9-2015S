I used my supplementary problem 3 from CSC161. I used sup-prob3 as the
default for make to run. I also added a clean function that removes all the
.o files from sup-prob3. 

When make is inputted into the terminal screen, it compiles sup-prob3. And
when I call make sup-prob3 again, it states that 'sup-prob3' is up to
date. 

Instead of typing all the compiling words into the terminal each time we
want to compile, all we have to do is call the make procedure and it
remembers the call for us.
